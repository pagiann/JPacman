=== version 1.01 - 2016-01-20 ===

- Added another submode in Pathfinding Visualization mode. In this submode the user is presented with an empty space, where
  he/she can set obstacles anywhere he/she wants and finally see the algorithm pathfinding visualization.
- Added octile heuristic function, and also added the other two heuristics (chebyshev, octile) to all heuristic algorithms.
- Fixed yet another bug in TSP, where AStarAlgorithmForTSP was using the Manhattan distance instead of the correct Euclidean
  one, which resulted not finding the optimal path in some cases (e.g. only one pill).
- Fixed a serious bug in A* algorithm, where if there was an equal node in the open list with a worst g value from the current
  neighbor node, it wasn't being updated with the correct (best values), resulting A* not finding the shortest path.
- Fixed and properly implemented IDS algorithm. Also remove mode parameter due to that and replaced with a "visualize iterations"
  button which toggles algorithms iterations visualization.
- Fixed IDS diagonal search to find best optimal path (in tiles in the way BFS does).
- Some minor visual improvements.
- Some minor bugs fixed.

=== version 1.0 - 2016-01-12 ===

- Added dynamic painting of nodes in graphical search tree in  
- Added paint of the unexpanded nodes (those currently in the search frontier) in the AI Algorithms Stepwise Learning mode.
- Added algorithm parameters for IDS and BS in AI Algorithms Stepwise Learning mode (you can change them) and 
  AI Algorithms Interactive Learning mode (you can't change them).
- Added dynamic coloring of the search tree nodes in synchronization with the maze ones.
- Replaced all sprites (except mazes) with new (Rando's ones).
- Replaced button "Toggle Expanded Nodes" with a button to set their color between two values: a default one, with shading from
  white to dark gray one and a maze based one, with shading from white to a light shade of maze's color.
- Changed "Step Size" with "Iterations" in AI Algorithms Stepwise Learning mode. For any number x > 1 the selected algorithm will
  perform x iterations (without displaying each individual step) before changing back to step-by-step execution. This also fixes
  the stepwise execution of the IDS algorithm.
- Changed Beam Search algorithm behavior, to keep the best nodes (beam) in memory based on the F=G+H cost and not the H cost. 
- Improved AI Algorithms Stepwise Execution mode. Added expanded nodes coloring. Also, to make auto mode more efficient, the action
  execution time changed to be quite fast (500ms/action) in order to complete more actions in less time and as a result the user
  can have a basic understanding of the algorithm (without executing the algorithm in manual mode).
- Improved UI of TSP.
- Fixed a bug where node maze tile location wasn't showing above everything else as it should.
- Fixed a bug when BS algorithm couldn't found a solution, the tile/node where user clicked wasn't being drawn as the goal node
  but the goal node of the path found was being drawn instead.
- Fixed a bug where IDS algorithm's parameters were being reset at the start of each new algorithm run.
- Fixed a bug where in the search tree of IDS algorithm, duplicate nodes of the solution path were painted.
- Fixed a bug where the heuristic function checkbox of the graphical search could be selected for any of the blind algorithms.
- Fixed and optimized TSP, and now the optimal/smallest path is always found. Removed closed list due to the fact that nodes in
  the closed list may be rediscovered and their cost improved. Only nodes in the open list are checked and if there is an equal
  node in the open list with larger fCost value it's removed and the current neighbor/child node is added in the open list.
- Fixed a bug in TSP where the user couldn't set a pill in pacman's initial start position.
- Some minor bugs fixed.
